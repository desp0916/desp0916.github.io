I have been working on real-time stream processing and analysis using Kafka, Storm and ELK stack for almost two years.

I think I am a developer and data engineer. The programming languages I use frequently include Java, PHP, JavaScript, Python, bash shell. I also know a little bit of R and node.js. I'm not only concerned with the tools that can leverage up our productivity and efficiency, but also the technologies that can improve the performance, availability and scalability. Therefore, I managed with any tools such as Docker, Mahout, Spark, Hive, HBase. My interests include Data Mining, Text Mining and Machine Learning.
